# hello-world
First github repo per tutorial

I have been coding for a while. but generally only in the capacity of "I need something that can do this and there isnt anything. time to learn a coding language enough to write a program myself for it in the simplest way possible!" (codes using much google. forgets how to code in that language) repeat!

I am taking a tutorial on coding for problem solving in the hopes that it will get things to stick better.
